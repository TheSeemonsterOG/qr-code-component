### What I learned

It was fun to learn about accessibility coding e.g.
```html
<article class="card" role="region" aria-labelledby="title">
```

First time using root which was very convenient
```css
:root{
--page:#d5e1ef;
--card:#ffffff;
--title:#1f314f;
--muted:#68778d;
--brand:#2c7dfa;


--card-w: 360px;
--card-radius: 18px;
}
```




### Continued development

It would be great to learn more about accessibility features and continuously implement it in future projects.
